## Exploratory Data Analysis - Spring 2019

...These files contain the projects completed for my ANLY 506 class. The following assignments are included
- Github Assignment
- Code portfolio
- Final project

# Final Project

...For the final project, I have chosen the Bike Vendors file. This file contains the followinf variables for analysis:
- Bike Model
- Category 1 (which I interpret as the terrain)
- Category 2 (which I interpret as surface type)
- Bike frame
- Price
- statistics for 30 stores in difference cities
- a speed column, which is empty

At this time, I am unsure of the value contained in the store columns.

# Project Goals

...The goal for the final project is to demonstrate the principles I have learnt in the duration of this class.
...This can be seen not only through the analysis of the final project, but also the code portfolio, which represents the coding methods I have learnt in the past 4 months.
